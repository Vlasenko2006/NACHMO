# This code contains a list of shortcutted experimental settings.
#
# NN structure:
#
#     Input -> bilinear layer -> MLP -> Gates (optional) ->
#     -> S-layer(optional) -> QP-layer(optional)-> output layer
#
#
#                      Experiment Names
#
# naive = perceptron having similar configuration as "naive" perceptron in
#         Sturm and Wechler (SW). Might differ by the number of layers and neurons.
#
# gated = naive + gates in the last layer (without s-layer) or before s-layer
#
# QP = gated + Quadratic programming in the last layer
#
# S_SVD = SVD-based matrix in the S-layer. We compute it as:
#      diffs = [np.diff(v, axis=0) for v in data] then
#      u, s, v = np.linalg.svd(z.T), and then
#      cut > 0: u[:, -cut:] = 0, where 'cut = Rank [s]'.
#      Ssur = u @ np.diag(s)
#
# Sp = Error projection matrix in the S-layer. We compute it as:
#     Same as above, with the difference that u[:, :-cut] = 0 and
#     Ssur =  np.eye(len(s), len(s)) - u @ u.T
#
# S_ST = Stoichiometry matrix in the S-layer
#
# Postfixes:
#     by default all NN equipped with gate and rectification. Exception are the settings
#     with corresponding options. 
#     no_gate: NN without gating layer. The same as naive, if no other postfixes specified.
#     no_rec: We cut off negative concentrations in the Chemical Stepper
#
#
#                                Options
#
#
# 1.) If you compute sliced rmse, set rollout_length = 2, rollout_length=1 is IC. To estimate
# one step ahead we need to set 2 instead of 1
#
# 2.) tries is the number of individual rms estimates. Applicable for cumulative rms estimates
# for rms slices its value = 1.
#
# 3.) n_steps is the desired time length in your dataset. Note that n_steps must not exceed the 
# actual time lenght of the uploaded concentrations
# 
# 4.) Note also that n_steps =< rollout_length + tries
#
# 5.) random_starts: True means that cumulative rmse will be computed from random points
#     random_starts: False means that cumulative rmse will be computed sequentially from ICs
#
# 6.) slices contain a list of points where sliced rmse will be copmuted
